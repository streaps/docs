## Version 1.2.3: Reorder Pages

_Release date: 14.09.2018_

**Important: Upgrade to PHP 7**: With version 1.2.3 TYPEMILL requires PHP Version 7.0 or higher. This is due to a library (CSRF-protection), that uses a PHP7 function that is not supported by PHP 5.6. PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 will run out of life cycle in december 2018, so you should upgrade your server to PHP 7.1 or PHP 7.2 anyway. 

Wow!! More than six weeks and only one feature: As of version 1.2.3 you can re-order your existing content. To do so, simply drag&drop the items in the new navigation of the author panel. It looks so easy, but it was so complex in the background!!

Follow the instruction for simple updates in the [documentation](/gettings-started/update) and simply update the `system` folder.

Be aware, that all existing content-files will be renamed if you reorder a file, because we add a new order-prefix to the file name. And be aware of some rules and limitations:

* You can move files to any other folder.
* Only folders are allowed at the first level.
* Folders can be reordered within the same level.
* But a folder can not be moved to another folder or another level.

Here is the reason for the last restriction: If you move a folder to another folder, then the adress (url) will change for the whole folder and all its content (pages). It is a nightmare for your readers and for google.

If you really want to reorder your content completely, then you have to do it on the file system for now. In version 2.3.5 you will be able to create new folders and files in the author system, so you can create a new folder and move all files to the new folder manually.

## Version 1.2.2: Draft Management

_Release date: 24.07.2018_

Version 1.2.2 introduces a draft management. Follow the instruction for simple updates in the [documentation](/gettings-started/update), so update the `system` folder and please also update the theme `typemill`.

The changes are:

- Safe a draft.
- Publish a page.
- Depublish a page.
- Delete a page.
- All buttons for editing are fixed at the bottom of the page now.
- Created a new shared contentController for the whole page management.
- Extended the content-api with update, depublish and delete functionalities.
- Converted markdown to json for edit- and draft-management (stored as txt).
- Extended the vue-js for the editor.

## Version 1.2.1: Improved editor and fixes

_Release date: 06.07.2018_

** Version 1.2.1 has an important security-update, so please switch to version 1.2.1 asap. Follow the instruction for simple updates**  in the [documentation](/gettings-started/update), so update the `system` folder and please also update the theme `typemill`.

The changes are:

* Fixed soft linebreaks in markdown. Now you can add two spaces at the end of a line and you will get a soft linebreak with `<br/>`.
* Fixed navigation-error. The navigation will work now if the content starts with multiple nested folders.

Now visit your startpage and click on the new setup-button. The button will direct you to the new setup page, where you can configure the basic system and the new cookieconsent-plugin.

Plugins are easy to use for writers, but a plugin system is pretty complex to implement for a developer, so there is a lot of new code. For now, there is no documentation for developers, but it will follow, soon.

Also introduced with 1.1.0 :
